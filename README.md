# Likelihood-alternation-with-belief
A prior probability greatly impacts and alters the likelihood and the posterior probability. Even though there are various conditional probabilities that occur in general situation or obvious situations, but a strong held belief can counter those conditions and predicts a totally absurd result. So a belief can be the known data and proven data on the similar environments. So conditionals are like rigid data but a belief acts more like generalized.
